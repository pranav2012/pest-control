Similarly, your pets may also get infected by the Mold/Fungus and can experience serious breathing complications. This costs you so much unnecessary money for treatment and medications."

          "text": "This kind of Fungal outgrowth is becoming a sporadic feature in urban constructions these days. Though there could be several reasons for its presence and one may have to get details of the interior works of the affected region from the homeowner. It is noticed that one common misadventure during interiors is the completion of structural plaster / POP or cladding on damp/moist surfaces by contractors without allowing it to thoroughly drying up or lack of curing period. It can be identified from the colour range from brown to black with multiple strains. This gets harder with seasoning. The particles on drying may disperse in air and gives lifetime asthma through a respiratory tracheal infusion."

          "text": "Firstly it is important to identify sources of water leakage or dampness as fungus are known to thrive upon moisture. If this is the case, even after eliminating the surface fungal outgrowth, if the affected area is not suitably dried up, there may be a chance of reoccurrence. This costs you unnecessary money because you will be required to keep repairing and painting the walls. Once the cause of dampness is fixed and surface dried up, then hire a professional Antifungal treatment company to access and undertake extensive Mold/mildew treatment for Walls, Ceiling and wood and other porous and non-porous surfaces."

It is similar to an earthy smell that you would find in a damp Basement. If you get down and smell the electrical outlets, then you will be able to more easily sniff out whether there is mold growth behind your walls. Electrical sockets and outlets have good access to the space behind the walls in your home."

Increased exposure to the mold without proper protective equipment can cause further damage to you. Additionally, if the mold is not cleaned properly with the right materials and precautions, it can linger and persist. If black mold remains in the home, you and your family will continue to be exposed and could eventually experience severe symptoms."

          "text": "While the toxic nature of bleach kills the Mold on non-porous surfaces, it can't do a good job on the surfaces that are even a little porous like concrete/wood. It is because all molds send root-like structures called \"Hyphae\" into the porous surface to gather the nutrients and the surface tension prevents traditional bleach & water solution from penetrating deeply enough into wood or concrete to kill these roots. This is one place where Third generation broad spectrum fungicide technologies are better than bleach solution for breaking the mold cycle."
