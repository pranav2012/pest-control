Though there could be several reasons for its presence and one may have to get details of the interior works of the affected region from the homeowner. It is noticed that one common misadventure during interiors is the completion of structural plaster / POP or cladding on damp/moist surfaces by contractors without allowing it to thoroughly drying up or lack of curing period. It can be identified from the colour range from brown to black with multiple strains. This gets harder with seasoning. The particles on drying may disperse in air and gives lifetime asthma through a respiratory tracheal infusion."

If this is the case, even after eliminating the surface fungal outgrowth, if the affected area is not suitably dried up, there may be a chance of reoccurrence. This costs you unnecessary money because you will be required to keep repairing and painting the walls. Once the cause of dampness is fixed and surface dried up, then hire a professional Antifungal treatment company to access and undertake extensive Mold/mildew treatment for Walls, Ceiling and wood and other porous and non-porous surfaces."

This is one place where Third generation broad spectrum fungicide technologies are better than bleach solution for breaking the mold cycle."
